# IMAGE-CRYPTOGRAPHY-PROJECT ->Image encryption is a procedure which converts plain image to an encrypted image by employing a secret key. The decryption process decrypts the cipher image into the original image by employing the secret key [3, 4]. Mainly, decryption operation is like encryption operation but applies in reverse order. The secret keys play a critical role in encryption. Because the security of the encryption approach is mainly dependent on it, two types of keys are utilized, namely, private key and public key [5, 6]. In the private key, the encryption and decryption processes use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the images. In the case of a public key, two keys are utilized, one key for encryption and one for decryption. In this, the encryption key is made public, but the decryption key is always kept private [7]. Figure 1 represents the block diagram of image encryption.
